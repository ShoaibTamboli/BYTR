BD 3 Assignment 2 (Optional)
Fitness Tracker
In this lesson, we will cover how to create a Fitness Tracker Backend using various JavaScript array methods. By the end of this lesson, you will have learned how to:

Add new activities to a tracker.

Sort activities by duration.

Filter activities by type.

Calculate the total calories burned.

Update the duration of an activity by its ID.

Delete an activity by its ID.

Delete all activities of a specific type.

Data Structure
We will use the following initial data structure for our fitness tracker:

let activities = [
  { activityId: 1, type: 'Running', duration: 30, caloriesBurned: 300 },
  { activityId: 2, type: 'Swimming', duration: 45, caloriesBurned: 400 },
  { activityId: 3, type: 'Cycling', duration: 60, caloriesBurned: 500 }
];

Note: Donâ€™t forget to add:

let cors = require('cors');

app.use(cors());

*/

let activities = [
  { activityId: 1, type: 'Running', duration: 30, caloriesBurned: 300 },

Summary
In this lesson, you will implement a series of endpoints to manage a fitness tracker. You will:

Add activities to the tracker using the GET /activities/add endpoint.

Sort activities by duration using the GET /activities/sort-by-duration endpoint.

Filter activities by type using the GET /activities/filter-by-type endpoint.

Calculate the total calories burned using the GET /activities/total-calories endpoint.

Update the duration of an activity using the GET /activities/update-duration endpoint.

Delete an activity by ID using the GET /activities/delete endpoint.

Delete activities by type using the GET /activities/delete-by-type endpoint.

By the end of this lesson, you should be comfortable performing basic CRUD operations and sorting/filtering activities based on their properties. Good luck and happy coding!
